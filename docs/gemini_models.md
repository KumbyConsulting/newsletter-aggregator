| `models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest` | Latest fast version of Gemini 1.5 | Most current efficient model |
| `models/gemini-1.5-flash-001` | Point release of Gemini 1.5 Flash | Stable fast responses |

### Vision Models

Models capable of processing and reasoning about images:

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `models/gemini-1.0-pro-vision-latest` | Latest vision-capable model | Image analysis, multimodal content |
| `models/gemini-pro-vision` | Standard vision model | Image processing tasks |

### Embedding Models

Models designed for creating vector embeddings:

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `models/embedding-001` | Standard embedding model | Vector embeddings for search |
| `models/embedding-gecko-001` | Gecko embedding model | Efficient embeddings |
| `models/text-embedding-004` | Advanced text embedding model | High-quality semantic search |
| `models/gemini-embedding-exp` | Experimental Gemini embedding model | Testing advanced embedding capabilities |

## Model Selection Strategy

Our application uses a fallback strategy to ensure it can always initialize with an appropriate model:

1. First attempts to use `models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest` as it offers good balance of capability and efficiency
2. If that fails, it checks available models and tries to initialize with other preferred models in order
3. Falls back to any available Gemini model if preferred models aren't available

## Usage in Our Application

### Direct API Access (GeminiDirectModel)

Used when `use_vertex_ai` is set to `False` in configuration:

```python
# Example initialization
model = genai.GenerativeModel('models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest')
response = model.generate_content("Your prompt here")
```

### Vertex AI Access (VertexAIModel)

Used when `use_vertex_ai` is set to `True` in configuration:

```python
# Example initialization
model = GenerativeModel('models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest')
response = model.generate_content(
    "Your prompt here",
    generation_config=generation_config
)
```

## Configuration Parameters

### Generation Configuration

We use the following default generation configuration:

```python
generation_config = GenerationConfig(
    temperature=0.4,  # Controls randomness (lower = more deterministic)
    top_p=0.8,        # Nucleus sampling parameter
    top_k=40,         # Limits token selection to top k
    max_output_tokens=2048  # Maximum response length
)
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Model Initialization Failures

If model initialization fails, check:
- API key validity
- Project permissions
- Network connectivity
- Whether the specific model is available in your region

### Empty Responses

Empty responses can be caused by:
- Safety filters blocking content
- API rate limits being exceeded
- Model availability issues

### Safety Filters

Some prompts may trigger safety filters, resulting in filtered responses. If this happens:
- Rephrase your query to avoid sensitive topics
- Check logs for specific safety filter triggers

## Best Practices

1. Use the most appropriate model for your task:
   - Use Flash models for quick, simple tasks
   - Use Pro models for complex reasoning
   - Use Vision models when processing images

2. Implement proper error handling for all API calls

3. Use retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures

4. Monitor resource usage and costs associated with different models
